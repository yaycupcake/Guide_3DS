为了在你的主机上安装 boot9strap，我们需要获得你主机上的唯一加密密钥。 To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your device.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

### 你需要准备点啥？

* The latest release of [nimhax](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/releases/latest) (the nimhax `.zip` file)

### 操作步骤

#### 第一步 – 准备工作

1. 将主机关机
1. 将你的 SD 卡插入到电脑
1. Copy the `nimhax` folder from the nimhax `.zip` to the `/3ds/` folder on your SD card
1. 将 SD 卡重新插入你的主机
1. 启动你的主机

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Choose an exploit

#### Bannerbomb3 (recommended)

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with BannerBomb3, which uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the System Settings application.

#### Frogtool

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
While this method is faster, it requires downloading a file with a torrent client. Do not follow this method if you're unable to use a torrent client.
