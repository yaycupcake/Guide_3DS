### Instructions

#### Section I - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. Launch udsploit from the list of homebrew
1. Once you see `patching kernel... done`, press (Start) to exit udsploit
  + This may take several tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. Launch safehax from the list of homebrew
  + If you get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, make sure you ran udsploit with Wireless Communication turned on
  + If you *still* get a "PM INIT FAILED" error, try using the [r19 release of safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/tag/r19)
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Section II - Installing boot9strap

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device

#### Section III - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#boot-related-issues-on-modded-devices)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot
  + If you get an error, just continue to the next page

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default as long as the SD card is inserted.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.
