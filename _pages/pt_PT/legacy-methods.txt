### Leitura Obrigatória

There have been multiple improvements and advancements to methods for installing CFW over the last short while.

For this reason, it is recommended you use the most up-to-date method found on the [Get Started](get-started) page.

However, "legacy" or outdated methods are kept here for various purposes. They will require that you have done [Seedminer](seedminer) first.

If you need help, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for assistance.

#### Section I - Compatibility Test

The following exploits make use of one of two DS-mode applications built into the 3DS: DS Internet Settings and DS Download Play.

If both DS Internet Settings and DS Download Play fail to work, you will have to repair them with [TWLFix-3DS](https://github.com/MechanicalDragon0687/TWLFix-3DS/releases/) using a homebrew entrypoint, such as PicHaxx.

#### DS Internet Settings Test (used for Fredtool)

1. Go to System Settings, then "Internet Settings", then "Nintendo DS Connections"
1. Press "OK"
1. If your device loads into a "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Setup" menu, the test was successful
  + If the screen stays black or appears to freeze, the test has failed
1. Exit this menu

#### DS Download Play Test (used for Frogtool)

1. Launch the Download Play application (![]({{ "/images/download-play-icon.png" | absolute_url }}){: height="24px" width="24px"})
1. Select "Nintendo DS"
1. If your device loads into a “Download software via DS Download Play” menu, the test was successful 
  + If the screen stays black or appears to freeze, the test has failed
