Before starting this guide, we will see if custom firmware is already installed and check the current system version of your device.

#### Section I - CFW Check

1. Power off your device
1. Hold the (Select) button
1. Power on your device while still holding the (Select) button
1. If you do not see an unusual menu (e.g. "Luma3DS Configuration"), you may proceed to the next section

If you see an unusual menu, STOP - you already have custom firmware! Continue from [here](checking-for-cfw#what-to-do-next).

#### Section II - System Version Check

1. Open the System Settings application
1. Your system version will be displayed on the bottom right of the top screen (e.g. "Ver. 11.16.0-49U")

#### Section III - Select a Method

To find the correct method for your device, please enter the system version you found in Section II.

{% capture noneSelected %}
System model is required.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture invalidVersion %}
This doesn't seem to be a valid system version.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture methodUnavailable %}
You currently cannot hack your 3DS on this version using the main methods. If you want to hack your console, you have to use ntrboot.
{% endcapture %}

{% include consoleVersionSelect.html noneSelected=noneSelected invalidVersion=invalidVersion methodUnavailable=methodUnavailable %}
