### Required Reading

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot)

This method requires temporary access to a Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS Lite that is compatible with your flashcart. This method uses the flashcart to run the ntrboot flasher `.nds` file on your NDS.

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](http://www.nds-card.net/))
