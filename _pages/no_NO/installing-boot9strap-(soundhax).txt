1. Slå av enheten
1. Sett inn SD-kortet i datamaskinen din

1. Copy `otherapp.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card

    {: .notice--info}

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Gå til `/SDCARD`, og spill deretter av "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + Dette kan ta flere forsøk
  + If it freezes, force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
  + If your console displays a red and white screen *and* your console is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, try following [Homebrew Launcher (Soundhax)](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))

    ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/soundhax-launch.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device

#### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + You can access the Luma3DS configuration menu at any time by powering off, holding SELECT, then powering on your device while still holding SELECT
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#boot-related-issues-on-modded-devices)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Trykk (Start) for å lagre og starte på nytt
  + If you get an error, just continue to the next page

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default as long as the SD card is inserted.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.
