<summary><strong>SD card location, type, and capacity</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/sdcard.jpg" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

The location of the SD card slot and the type of SD card that is accepted depends on the model of your 3DS. More information can be found on [Nintendo's official support page](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/271/~/how-to-insert-an-sd-card-or-microsd-card).


The 3DS can read SD cards of any capacity (even those larger than 32GB), but the card must be formatted as FAT32 (**not** exFAT or NTFS). You can use one of the following tools to format your SD card, depending on your operating system: [Windows](formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](formatting-sd-(linux)). SD cards larger than **128GB** are not recommended due to known issues with custom themes and GBA/DS graphics.

To follow this guide, you'll need an SD card with a capacity of at least **2GB**.
{: .notice--warning}

If you want, you can check your SD card for errors before following this guide using [H2testw (Windows)](h2testw-(windows)), [F3 (Linux)](f3-(linux)), or [F3XSwift (Mac)](f3xswift-(mac))

<summary><strong>Potential risks</strong></summary>

By modding your device, you subject it to the remote (but non-zero) possibility of the device being banned from online play or bricked (rendered non-functional). ___Incorrect file placement will NOT brick your device___, but purposely skipping instructions might. Similarly, the last ban wave occurred over five years ago, but there is no guarantee that another one will not occur in the future.

In short: Modding your device is safe, but it's ___your responsibility___ if something goes wrong.

## Things you need to do on your computer

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Downloading and copying files</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/github.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

In this guide, you will copy files that are downloaded on your computer/phone to your 3DS SD card. Many of these files come from GitHub, so refer to the above screenshot if you're unfamiliar with how to download files from there.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>Opening/extracting files</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/zipfiles.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Some of the files that you will be asked to download come in the `.zip` file format, which is used to package multiple files into one file.

When you are told to "copy (file) from (file).zip", that means that you need to open (or "extract") the ZIP file. Inside the ZIP file will be the file you're looking for, after which you can copy it to the specified location on your SD card.

On most operating systems, you can extract files by double-clicking the file. If this doesn't work, you can install a reputable third-party extraction tool like [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) instead.

{% capture compat %}
<summary><strong>(Windows only) File extensions</strong></summary>
![]({{ "/images/screenshots/onboarding/fileext.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

If your computer is running Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default, which may make it harder to find the files you're looking for. To enable file extensions, follow [these instructions](file-extensions-(windows)).
