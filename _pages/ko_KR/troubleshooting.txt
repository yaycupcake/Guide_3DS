## Seedminer

### Multiple long folder names in Nintendo 3DS folder

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/multiple-id0.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

This occurs when you use your SD card in multiple 3DS devices and is intended to prevent inadvertently merging data that would not be valid on other devices. To figure out which long folder name is correct for your 3DS, follow these instructions:

1. `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더를 `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` 폴더로 이름을 변경해 주세요
1. SD 카드를 기기에 다시 삽입하고 기기를 시작해 주세요
1. 기기가 SD 카드 데이터를 생성할 때까지 기다려 주세요
	+ 당신의 앱들이 사라졌을 것입니다. 이는 정상이며, 잠시 후에 고쳐질 것입니다.
1. 전원을 끄고 SD 카드를 컴퓨터에 삽입해 주세요
1. SD 카드의 `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더를 열어 주세요
1. `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더 내 32글자의 폴더 이름을 복사해 주세요
	+ This is your true ID0 that you will use in [Section II of Seedminer](seedminer#section-ii---seedminer)
1. `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더를 삭제해 주세요
1. `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` 폴더를 `Nintendo 3DS` 폴더로 이름을 변경해 주세요

### Bruteforce Movable skips to step 4

The website has already mined your `movable.sed` using your friend code and ID0 combination. You can use the `movable.sed` that it provides you.

### Important! You have been locked out of the automated part1 dumper system...

Your friend code was blocked from using the friend code bot because your 3DS did not successfully friend the bot. Ensure your 3DS is properly connected to the Internet, then join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask to be unlocked.

### We were unable to successfully complete your bruteforce request. :`(

The website has determined that your `movable.sed` cannot be brute-forced. Ensure that you gave the correct ID0 to the website. If your ID0 is correct, then you will be unable to use Seedminer and you will have to use an alternate method that will require additional games or hardware.

## boot9strap 설치 (PicHaxx)

### "An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..." (black screen with text)

Your `00000001.sav` and/or `otherapp.bin` files may be misplaced. Ensure that `00000001.sav` is in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `00040000` -> `0017c100` -> `data` and that `otherapp.bin` is on the root of your SD card.

If your files are in the correct locations, re-create the save using the [PicHaxx Save Tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/pichaxx.php), then place it in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `title` -> `00040000` -> `0017c100` -> `data`. Ensure that the file is named exactly `00000001.sav` and that you used your console's `movable.sed` to create it. Re-download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card. Do not add the `.bin` extension if you do not already see it.

## boot9strap 설치 (USM)

### DSiWare Management menu crashes without showing USM menu

Ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. If it is, then re-create it with the [unSAFE_MODE Exploit Injector](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/unsafemode.php). If this fails, then custom firmware may have been uninstalled on this device in a way that makes this method impossible to perform. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

## BannerBomb3

### DSiWare Management menu does not crash

`F00D43D5.bin` is missing from `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. Make sure that `Nintendo DSiWare` is correctly spelled and spaced. Uppercase/lowercase does not matter.

### DSiWare Management shows a question mark

There may be an issue with your `F00D43D5.bin` file (it may be corrupted or intended for the wrong 3DS). Re-create your `F00D43D5.bin` file with the [BannerBomb3 tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php), ensuring that you use the `movable.sed` file for your console.

### DSiWare Management menu crashes without purple screen

Ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. If it is, then re-create it with the [BannerBomb3 tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php). If this fails, then custom firmware may have been uninstalled on this device in a way that makes this method impossible to perform. If this is the case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

### Unable to enter Rosalina due to broken button(s)

Download this [alternate config.bin](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/196635695958196224/733384123003175074/config.bin) and place it in `/luma/`. This will change the Rosalina key combination to (Y) + (B).

### "An exception occurred" after trying to launch Homebrew Launcher via Download Play

There is an issue with your `boot.3dsx` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest) and place `boot.3dsx` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

### GodMode9에서 "Scripts directory not found"

You did not copy the `gm9` folder from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the root of your SD card. Download the latest release of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases/latest) and place the `gm9` folder on the root of your SD card, merging it with the existing one.

### `/gm9/out/` 폴더에 `essentials.exefs`가 없음

Your device had custom firmware in the past, so you were not automatically prompted to make a backup. Make a backup manually:

1. SD 카드를 기기에 다시 삽입해 주세요
1. (Start)를 길게 누르고, 이 상태에서 전원을 켜 주세요. GodMode9이 실행 될 겁니다
1. `[S:] SYSNAND VIRTUAL` 폴더로 이동해 주세요
1. Select `essentials.exefs`, then `Copy to 0:/gm9/out/`
1. You should now have `essentials.exefs` in `/gm9/out/`

---

## 해킹 된 기기에 부팅 문제

The steps detailed here generally assume that your device has a modern custom firmware setup (boot9strap + Luma3DS 8.0 or greater). If your console is running an older homebrew setup (for example, something based on arm9loaderhax or menuhax), you should update your setup before trying these instructions.
{: .notice--info}

### My device powers off when I try to turn it on, and/or the notification LED shows a color on boot

There is an issue with your `boot.firm` file. If you're running [boot9strap 1.4](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/tag/1.4), your 3DS notification LED may flash a certain color. This color is used to diagnose issues involving your `boot.firm` file on SD card or internal memory. On older versions of boot9strap, the blue light will power off almost immediately when trying to turn on the device.

If the notification LED flashes:

- **White**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card or on internal memory.
- **Magenta**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card. It was able to find `boot.firm` on internal memory, but the file is corrupted.
- **Red**: Your 3DS was able to find `boot.firm` on both your SD card and on internal memory, but both files are corrupted.

You can get a new `boot.firm` file by downloading the [latest release of Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest), extracting it, and placing `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card. If your `boot.firm` file is consistently being detected as corrupted, you may want to check your SD card for errors ([Windows](h2testw-(windows)), [Linux](f3-(linux)), or [macOS](f3xswift-(mac))). Also, note that the 3DS tends to have issues with files extracted using WinRAR.

If you hear a "popping sound", potentially accompanied with the backlight turning on for a split second, there is a hardware issue with your device (such as a disconnected backlight cable). You may be able to get your device to boot by holding it at certain angles.

### My device gets stuck on a black screen, with a static blue light

The steps below can be attempted in any order, but are listed from least to most time-consuming.

1. Power off your device, eject the game cartridge if inserted, power on your device, then wait up to ten minutes. If your device boots within ten minutes, the issue has been fixed and is unlikely to reoccur
1. Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card to `Nintendo 3DS_BACKUP`, then attempt to boot. If your device successfully boots, there is some issue within your `Nintendo 3DS` folder. Try clearing HOME Menu extdata:
	+ Navigate to `/Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/extdata/00000000/`
  + Delete the corresponding folder for your 3DS region: 
		+ **EUR 지역**: `00000098`
		+ **JPN 지역**: `00000082`
		+ **USA 지역**: `0000008f`
		+ **CHN 지역**: `000000A1`
		+ **KOR 지역**: `000000A9`
		+ **TWN 지역**: `000000B1`
1. Ensure that your device does not have ARM11 exception handlers disabled:
	+ 기기를 종료해 주세요
	+ Hold (Select)
	+ Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
	+ If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it
	+ If your device now boots to the "An exception occurred" screen, follow [My device boots to an error screen](troubleshooting#my-device-boots-to-an-error-screen)
1. Try booting into recovery mode and updating your system:
	+ 기기를 종료해 주세요
	+ Hold (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A)
	+ Power on your device
	+ If you were successful, the device will boot to an "update your system" screen
1. Follow the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide
1. For further support, ask for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp)

### My device boots to an error screen

#### "An error has occurred: Failed to apply 1 FIRM patch(es)" or "An exception has occurred -- Current process: pm"

Your Luma3DS version is outdated. Download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.

#### "An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..."

ARM11 exception handlers are disabled, or custom firmware is not installed. Try enabling ARM11 exception handlers:
  + 기기를 종료해 주세요
  + Hold (Select)
  + Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
  + If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it

#### Some other error

Please take a photo of the error and join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

### Blue "Bootrom Error" screen

Your device is likely hard-bricked. You will need to buy an ntrboot flashcart to reinstall boot9strap in order to attempt to fix your device. This may also indicate a hardware issue that cannot be fixed. In any case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.
  + It is also possible that someone has set a boot-time splash screen that just looks like a brick. Try leaving your device powered on, waiting on the blue screen, for five minutes.
