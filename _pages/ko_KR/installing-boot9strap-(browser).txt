1. 기기를 시작해 주세요.

#### Section II - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

1. 기기를 시작해 주세요.
1. On the HOME Menu, press the Left and Right shoulder buttons together to open the camera
  + If you are unable to open the camera, open the Internet Browser and manually type the URL instead (`https://zoogie.github.io/web/nbhax`)
1. Tap the QR code button and scan [this QR code](http://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?color=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF&data=https%3A%2F%2Fzoogie.github.io%2Fweb%2Fnbhax&qzone=1&margin=0&size=400x400&ecc=L)
  + If you get an error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#installing-boot9strap-browser)
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller

#### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. Wait for all checks to complete
1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it has completed, press (A) to reboot your device

#### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#boot-related-issues-on-modded-devices)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default as long as the SD card is inserted.

  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.
