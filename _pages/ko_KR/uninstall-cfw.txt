title: "Uninstall CFW"
---

{% include toc title="목차" %}

### 중요

This will completely remove CFW from your device, including boot9strap and Luma3DS, for the purpose of restoring the device to stock.

This is never the solution to fix any issues you may be encountering with your CFW installation. A better idea would be to ask (in English) for help at [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp).
{: .notice--danger}

Any unsigned (illegitimate) games will be rendered unusable and should be manually removed before starting this process by using the Data Management section of the System Settings. Use a [save manager](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest) to backup any saves for these unsigned (illegitimate) games you care about.

If you have modified critical system software (such as editing the home menu, unbanning your console, region changing, etc.), uninstalling CFW WILL BRICK your device! Ensure that you follow all sections of this page.
{: .notice--danger}

These instructions will only work on devices with a Luma3DS version of 8.0 or higher. If you have an older version of Luma, you must upgrade your setup before following these instructions. Follow [this page](checking-for-cfw) to find your upgrade instructions.
{: .notice--warning}

만약 여러분의 SD카드의 `/luma/payloads/` 폴더에서 `GodMode9.firm`이 아닌 다른 페이로드 파일이 추가로 있다면, (Start)를 누르고 부팅시에 화면에 표시되는 "chainloader menu" 에서 D패드랑 (A) 버튼으로 조작하여 "GodMode9"을 선택하여야 합니다.
