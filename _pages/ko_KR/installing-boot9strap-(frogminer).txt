title: "Installing Boot9strap (Frogtool)"
---

{% include toc title="목차" %}

### 중요

We will now use our Homebrew Launcher access to run the Frogtool utility in order to inject the exploitable Japanese version of the "Flipnote Studio" title, which we then use to run b9sTool and install boot9strap.

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
