### 必讀事項

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

We can do this using an existing exploit, BannerBomb3.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile to your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up) or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to use a [Legacy Method](legacy-methods). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

### 必備項目

* 您自 [Seedminer](seedminer) 步驟中所取得的 `movable.sed` 檔案
* The latest release archive for [Luma3DS](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases/latest)

#### 第一節 — 準備工作

1. Open [unSAFE_MODE-bb3 tool](https://usm.bruteforcemovable.com/) on your computer
  + If this site is nonfunctional, try using [this one](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/unsafemode.php)
1. Upload your movable.sed using the "Choose File" option
1. Click "Download unSAFE_MODE-bb3 archive"
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` and a SAFE_MODE exploit data file called `usm.bin` inside of a zip folder (`unSAFE_MODE-bb3.zip`)
1. If your console is powered on, power off your console
1. 將 SD 卡插入至電腦中
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` from the USM archive (`unSAFE_MODE-bb3.zip`) to the root of your SD card
1. 於您的 SD 卡中，移動至 `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`
  + 此 `<ID0>` 字串將與您在 [Seedminer](seedminer) 中所使用的字串一樣
  + If `Nintendo DSiWare` does not exist, create it
1. If there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) in this folder, move them to your PC
  + This will leave you with an empty Nintendo DSiWare folder. Moving the files to your PC ensures you don't delete any intentional backups
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from the USM archive (`unSAFE_MODE-bb3.zip`) to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder

#### Section II - BannerBomb3

1. 將 SD 卡插回主機中
1. 啟動您的主機
1. 於您主機上啟動系統設定 (System Settings)
1. 移動至 `檔案管理 (Data Management)` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your bottom screen should flash Red and then the system will reboot to home menu a few seconds later. This means the exploit profile was successfully copied
  + If the bottom screen does not flash Red, the exploit profile was not copied and you will not be able to complete the next section. Ensure that your files are properly placed, then try again
1. 關閉您的主機

#### Section III - unSAFE_MODE

1. With your system still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), then press (Power)
  + Release the buttons after a few seconds. Your console will boot into Safe Mode
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup`
1. Once you see `B9S install SUCCESS` on the top screen, press any button to reboot to Luma Configuration

#### 第四節 — 設定 Luma3DS

1. Your device should automatically show the Luma Configuration menu
1. 透過方向鍵及『A』以開啟下列選項：
  + **『Show NAND or user string in System Settings』**
1. 按『Start』鍵以存檔並重新啟動系統
  + Your device should load the Home Menu after a short delay. If you get a black screen lasting longer than 5 minutes, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#black-screen-on-sysnand-boot-after-installing-boot9strap)

#### Section V - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

1. 於您主機上啟動系統設定 (System Settings)
1. 移動至 `檔案管理 (Data Management)` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your bottom screen should flash Green and then the system will reboot to home menu a few seconds later. This means your WiFi configuration profiles were successfully restored
1. Power your system off
1. 將 SD 卡插入至電腦中
1. 於您的 SD 卡中，移動至 `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`
  + 此 `<ID0>` 字串將與您在 [Seedminer](seedminer) 中所使用的字串一樣
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder
1. Continue to Finalizing Setup
