### Okumanız Gerekli

Sistem DSiWare dosyasını çıkartabilmek için Settings (Ayarlar) uygulamasında bulunan DSiWare Data Management (DSiWare Veri Yönetimi) kısmındaki bir açıktan yararlanıyoruz.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to dump the DSi Internet Settings application to the SD root.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If you have a Taiwanese console (indicated by a T after the system version), follow [this page](bannerbomb3-fredtool-(twn)) instead.

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)

#### Section I - Prep Work
1. Open [BannerBomb3 Tool](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/bannerbomb3.php) on your computer
1. Upload your movable.sed using the "Choose File" option
1. Click "Build and Download"
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` inside of a zip file (`BannerBomb3.zip`)
1. If your console is powered on, power off your console
1. SD kartınızı bilgisayarınıza takın
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
  + This `<ID0>` will be the same one that you used in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + If `Nintendo DSiWare` does not exist, create it
1. If there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) in this folder, move them to your PC
  + This will leave you with an empty Nintendo DSiWare folder. Moving the files to your PC ensures you don't delete any intentional backups
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from the BannerBomb3 `.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder

#### Section II - BannerBomb3
1. SD kartınızı cihazınıza tekrar takın
1. Power on your device
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your system should flash Magenta (pink/purple) and then crash a few seconds later. This means it worked
1. Cihazınızı kapatın
1. SD kartınızı bilgisayarınıza takın
1. You should now have `42383841.bin` in SD root.  This is the DSiWare backup you will use later in the guide
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<32-character-id>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
  + This `<ID0>` will be the same one that you used in [Seedminer](seedminer)
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from the Nintendo DSiWare folder and from your computer. This file will not be needed anymore
