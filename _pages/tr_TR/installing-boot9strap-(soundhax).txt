### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger both Soundhax and universal-otherapp.

1. Power off your device
1. SD kartınızı bilgisayarınıza takın
1. Copy the Soundhax `.m4a` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Copy `otherapp.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device

#### Section II - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

In this section, you will launch Soundhax through the Nintendo 3DS Sound app, which will use universal-otherapp to launch the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Cihazınızdan Nintendo 3DS Sound uygulamasını çalıştırın

    {: .notice--info}

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. `/SDCARD` gidin, "<3 nedwill 2016" dosyasını oynatın
  + This may take many (up to 10) tries
  + If you see the message "Could not play", you are either on a system version incompatible with Soundhax or downloaded the wrong Soundhax release
  + If it freezes, force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
  + If you get a different error, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#installing-boot9strap-soundhax)
