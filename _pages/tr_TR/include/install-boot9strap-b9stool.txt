In this section, you will perform a series of very specific steps within Flipnote Studio that, when performed correctly, will launch the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. Complete the initial setup process for the launched game until you reach the main menu
  + Select the left option whenever prompted during the setup process
1. Using the touch-screen, select the large left box, then select the box with an SD card icon
1. Once the menu loads, select the face icon, then the bottom right icon to continue
1. Press (X) or (UP) on the D-Pad depending on which is shown on the top screen
1. Select the second button along the top with a film-reel icon
1. Scroll right until reel "3/3" is selected
1. Tap the third box with the letter "A" in it
1. Scroll left until reel "1/3" is selected
1. Tap the fourth box with the letter "A" in it
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded b9sTool
1. Using the D-Pad, move to "Install boot9strap"
{%- if include.method == "dsinternet" %}
  + If you miss this step, the system will exit to HOME Menu instead of installing boot9strap and you will need to open Nintendo DS Connections and start over from the beginning of this section
{%- elsif include.method == "dsdlp" %}
  + If you miss this step, the system will exit to HOME Menu instead of installing boot9strap and you will need to open DS Download Play and start over from the beginning of this section
{%- endif %}
1. Press (A), then press START and SELECT at the same time to begin the process
1. Once completed and the bottom screen says "done.", exit b9sTool, then power off your device
  + You may have to force power off by holding the power button
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + If you see the Luma Configuration screen, power off your device and continue to the next section
