Before starting this guide, we will see if custom firmware is already installed and check the current system version of your device.

#### Section I - CFW Check

1. デバイスの電源を切ります
1. Hold the (Select) button
1. Power on your device while still holding the (Select) button
1. If you do not see an unusual menu (e.g. "Luma3DS Configuration"), you may proceed to the next section

#### Section II - System Version Check

1. Open the System Settings application
1. Your system version will be displayed on the bottom right of the top screen (e.g. "Ver. 11.17.0-50U")

#### Section III - Select a Method

To find the correct method for your device, please enter the system version you found in Section II.
