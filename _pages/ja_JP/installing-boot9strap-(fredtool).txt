### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare eShop title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application. This requires you to already own (or download / buy) a DSiWare game from the eShop.

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

To extract the `.7z` and `.rar` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

### What You Need
