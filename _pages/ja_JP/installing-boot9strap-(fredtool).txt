Seedminer-based methods have been replaced by easier, safer methods. Please return to [Get Started](get-started) unless you have a legitimate reason to follow this page (such as broken shoulder buttons).
{: .notice--warning}

### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application. This requires you to have a DSiWare backup, for example from BannerBomb or the DSiWare Dumper tool.

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

### 必要なもの

* A DSiWare Backup (such as the one on SD root from [BannerBomb3](bannerbomb3))
* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [Frogminer_save](https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [b9sTool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest)
