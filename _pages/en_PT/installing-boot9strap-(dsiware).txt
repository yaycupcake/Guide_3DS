### Required Reading

There are three different methods of installing boot9strap using DSiWare on 11.7.0.

The first method, Seedminer, requires a PC with a powerful graphics card. There is an online helping service for Seedminer if you do not have access to such a PC. The two other methods require a system transfer from a hacked 3DS.

___

The Seedminer method only requires a cheap DSiWare game, available from the eShop. Additionally, access to CFW or the Homebrew Launcher is needed for  extracting your 3DS' `movable_part1.sed` file, and a PC with a powerful graphics card is needed for bruteforcing the `movable_part1.sed` file into a `movable.sed` file. The [online Seedminer helper service](https://seedhelper.figgyc.uk/) can automatically do these things for you if you do not have access to them.

The method uses a series of oversights in the 3DS' security, detailed [here](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3).

___

The latter two methods require two devices. One 3DS (or 2DS) must be running boot9strap and is referred to as the *source 3DS*, while the other 3DS (or 2DS) is on stock 11.7.0 and referred to as the *target 3DS*.

Both of these methods will assume that the 3DS running custom firmware is using boot9strap and has completed this guide. While it is possible to do these methods with some other kind of custom firmware, that is out of the scope of this guide.

Both of these methods use a combination of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws), and an oversight that allows DSiWare titles to read and write to anywhere in encrypted NAND.

Both of these methods require you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS or New 2DS -> New 3DS or New 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or Old 2DS -> Old 3DS or Old 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or Old 2DS -> New 3DS or New 2DS   

Both systems MUST be from the same region.
{: .notice--warning} 

In both of these methods, the source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo (details can be found in the instructions)! System Transfers can only be performed once a week per NNID.

#### Installing boot9strap (Seedminer)

This method does not require a hacked source 3DS or a System Transfer. You only need a compatible game on the 3DS you want to hack.

___

#### Installing boot9strap (DSiWare Save Injection)

This method requires that the source 3DS already legitimately owns one of the following games:
    
  + "Fieldrunners"
  + "Legends of Exidia"
  + "Guitar Rock Tour"
  + "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords"
    
A pirated copy of the game will *not* work, and all of these games have been pulled from the eShop.
