### Required Reading

If you have already hacked your device before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. Note that th' terms EmuNAND 'n RedNAND be referrin' to slightly different implementations 'o [th' same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

Soundhax (when combined with pre9otherapp) is compatible with versions 5.0.0 through 8.1.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.

To extract the `.7z` files linked on this page, you will need a file archiver like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/).

Note that cartridge updates will only deliver updates to core features, such as the System Settings, Home Menu, etc. cartridge updates will not deliver updates to Nintendo 3DS Sound and Network features, such as System Transfer, Internet Browser, StreetPass Mii Plaza, or eShop.

This means that using a cartridge update from a version containing an older Nintendo 3DS Sound version *(<3.0.0)* to one that introduced a newer Nintendo 3DS Sound version will break [Soundhax](homebrew-launcher-(soundhax))! You will need an [alternate method](installing-boot9strap-(mset)) of entering the Homebrew Launcher!
