<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

To install boot9strap on your device, we derive your device's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use the Homebrew Launcher to launch nimhax and dump the data encryption key (movable.sed) from your device.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/luigoalma/nimhax/) for information about the nimhax exploit.

#### Section II - nimhax

1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch nimhax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, a `movable.sed` file will appear on the root of your SD card

### Next step: Choose an exploit

#### Bannerbomb3 (recommended)

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with BannerBomb3, which uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the System Settings application.

#### Frogtool

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you can use it in conjunction with Frogtool, which uses your `movable.sed` file to inject and take advantage of JPN Flipnote Studio. \
While this method is faster, it requires downloading a file with a torrent client. Do not follow this method if you're unable to use a torrent client.
