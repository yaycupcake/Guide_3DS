### Required Reading

This page is for existing boot9strap users to update their installation of boot9strap to the latest version.

{% capture notice-1 %}
While we believe custom firmware is relatively safe at this time, it is important to note that it will never be "ban free".

You should avoid the following actions:
1. Piracy
1. Cheating online
1. Suspicious behaviour on eShop (for example, credit card chargebacks)

We believe SpotPass and StreetPass are also safe for use at this time.
