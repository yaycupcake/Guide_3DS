### Required Reading

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

As we already have Homebrew access, we can use slotTool to do this.

This specific method is intended to be used with Homebrew Launcher access through [BrowserHax 2020](homebrew-launcher-(browserhax-2020)).

If you have Homebrew Launcher access through another entry point, you should use [Frogtool](installing-boot9strap-(frogtool)).

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up) or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to use a [Legacy Method](legacy-methods). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.
