#### Section II - Launching SafeB9SInstaller

In this section, you will launch Soundhax through the Nintendo 3DS Sound app, which will use universal-otherapp to launch the boot9strap (custom firmware) installer.

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Buka Nintendo 3DS Sound

    {: .notice--info}

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Pergi ke `/SDCARD`, kemudian mainkan "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + This may take many (up to 10) tries
  + If you see the message "Could not play", you are either on a system version incompatible with Soundhax or downloaded the wrong Soundhax release
  + If it freezes, force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
