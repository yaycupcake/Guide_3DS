### Required Reading

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to decrypt any DSiWare title for the purposes of injecting an exploitable DSiWare title into the DS Internet Settings application. This requires you to have a DSiWare backup, for example from BannerBomb or the DSiWare Dumper tool.

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).

### What You Need

* A DSiWare Backup (such as the one on SD root from [BannerBomb3](bannerbomb3))
* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [Frogminer_save](https://github.com/zoogie/Frogminer/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [b9sTool](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest)

1. Tap the third box with the letter "A" in it
1. Scroll left until reel "1/3" is selected
1. Tap the fourth box with the letter "A" in it
1. If the exploit was successful, your device will have loaded b9sTool
1. Using the D-Pad, move to "Install boot9strap"
  + If you miss this step, the system will exit to HOME Menu instead of installing boot9strap and you will need to start over from Step 12 of Section III
1. Press (A), then press START and SELECT at the same time to begin the process
1. Once completed and the bottom screen says "done.", exit b9sTool, then power off your device
  + You may have to force power off by holding the power button
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + If you see the Luma Configuration screen, press (Start) to reboot, then continue with the guide

#### Section V - Luma3DS Verification

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Verify that a `luma` folder exists and that `config.ini` is inside of it
  + The existence of these folders and files confirms that Luma3DS is installed
  + If you do not see the `luma` folder or `config.ini`, [follow this troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/zoogie/b9sTool/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will install useful homebrew applications to complete your setup.

#### Section VI - Restoring DS Connection Settings

1. Copy the `42383841.bin` file from the `output/clean/` folder of the downloaded DSiWare archive (`fredtool.zip`) to the `Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/Nintendo DSiWare/` folder on your SD card
