### Required Reading

To install boot9strap on your device, we derive your device's unique encryption key. To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the data encryption key (movable.sed) for your device.

For information on how Seedminer works, see [this presentation](https://zoogie.github.io/web/34⅕c3).

This method uses a powerful graphics card to perform the calculations needed. A volunteer-run website is used for the purpose of assisting you with this method.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see inside Nintendo 3DS
  + Do not go inside any more folders
  + If you see multiple folders, follow [these instructions](troubleshooting#multiple-long-folder-names-in-nintendo-3ds-folder)

	![]({{ "/images/screenshots/id0-example.png" | absolute_url }})
	{: .notice--info}
1. Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later
  + This folder name is also known as your "ID0"
1. Power on your device
  + Your SD card does not need to be inserted at this point
1. Go to your Friend List (the [orange Face Icon]({{ "/images/friend-list-icon.png" | absolute_url }}) in the top row of your HOME Menu)
  + If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your device cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues)
1. Find your Mii profile, then find the "Friend Code" field on the top screen

#### Section II - Seedminer

1. Open [Bruteforce Movable](https://seedminer.hacks.guide/) on your computer
  + This site can automate the retrieval of `movable_part1.sed` (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer)
  + If the site isn't working, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the "Your friend code" field
1. Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the "Your ID0" field
  + Do not attempt to enter the ID0 by hand. Ensure the ID0 is entered correctly by copying and pasting it from where you saved it in the previous section
1. Select "Go"
  + If the site immediately goes to step 4, the website has already correctly processed your bruteforce request. You can download your `movable.sed` file and continue to the next section. You do not need to re-add the bot
1. When prompted, use the "Register Friend" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console
  + The name of the bot does not matter
1. Wait for the site to update
  + If it does not, wait a few minutes before refreshing the page once
1. Once the site processes your information, the site will continue to `Step 2: Bruteforce` automatically
1. Wait for the remainder of the process to complete
  + This is usually fast (1-5 minutes) but in some cases, can take up to half an hour
  + During this process, the bot you added may not show up on your 3DS. As long as the website updates, this is not an issue
  + If you are still waiting after half an hour, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you
1. When the process is completed, download your `movable.sed` file from the site
  + Keep this file as you will need it in the upcoming pages

### Next Steps

Once you have your device's encryption key (`movable.sed`), you will use it in conjunction with other exploits to install custom firmware on your 3DS. Select an exploit below.

#### PicHaxx + universal-otherapp (Recommended)

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used in conjunction with universal-otherapp to install custom firmware.

This route requires the Pokémon Picross application (free on eShop), and thus requires eShop access and a 3DS with a region of USA, EUR, or JPN.

#### Installing boot9strap (unSAFE_MODE)

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to take advantage of exploits in the SAFE_MODE firmware present in all 3DS units.

This route is only recommended if you are for some reason unable to follow the PicHaxx + universal-otherapp route, such as lack of eShop access or using a Korean 3DS.

#### Taiwan consoles only

If you have a Taiwanese device (indicated with a T at the end of the system version, such as 11.15.0-39**T**), you must follow this route. **Other regions may not follow this route.**
