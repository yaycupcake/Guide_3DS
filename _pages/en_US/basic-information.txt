If this is your first time modding a 3DS (or you're unfamiliar with technology), keep reading! Otherwise, if you have prior experience and know what you're doing, skip to [Get Started](get-started).

This page covers some of the base computer terminology and 3DS-specific quirks that you should know before following this guide.

## 3DS compatibility

This guide is compatible with every retail device in the Nintendo 3DS family of consoles (including the New 3DS series and the 2DS), regardless of region or firmware. 

## Risks of installing custom firmware

By modding your device, you subject it to the remote (but non-zero) possibility of the console being banned from online play or bricked (rendered permanently non-functional). **Incorrect file placement will not brick your device**, but purposely skipping instructions might. Similarly, the last ban wave occurred over five years, but there is no guarantee that another one will not occur in the future.

After custom firmware is installed, it is possible for a system update to occur that custom firmware is unable to account for. Should you install the update, your 3DS may be rendered **temporarily** unable to boot until Luma3DS is updated. You can get up-to-date information about system updates on the homepage of this guide.

## Computer compatibility

You can follow this guide as long as you are able to download files from the Internet and copy them to your SD card. Depending on your computer/phone/electronic device, you may need to purchase a USB to SD card adapter to actually allow your computer to read your SD card.

## Downloading, copying, and extracting files

A large part of this guide involves copying files that are downloaded on your computer/phone to your 3DS SD card. Many of these files come from GitHub, so refer to the above screenshot if you're unfamiliar with how to download files from there.

{: .notice--info}

Many of the files that you will be asked to download come in the `.zip` file format. Doing this allows multiple files to be downloaded at once, which makes it easier to organize what is being downloaded.

When you are told to "copy (file) from (file).zip", that means that you need to open the ZIP file. Inside the ZIP file will be the file you're looking for, from which you can drag-and-drop it to the specified location on your SD card.

On most operating systems, you can extract files by simply double-clicking the file. If this doesn't work for whatever reason, you can install a reputable third-party extraction tool like [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) instead.

## Windows only: File extensions

{: .notice--info}

If your computer is running Windows, file extensions may be hidden by default. Depending on the applications installed on your computer, this may make it harder to find the files you're looking for. To enable file extensions, follow [these instructions](file-extensions-(windows)).

## SD card location and physical size

{: .notice--info}

The location of the SD card slot and the type of SD card that is accepted depends on the model of your 3DS. More information can be found on [Nintendo's official support page](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/271/~/how-to-insert-an-sd-card-or-microsd-card).

- On the **Old 3DS**, **Old 3DS XL**, and **2DS**, the SD card is hidden behind a flap on the left or right side of the console. These consoles use a **large-size SD card**. A **microSD card in an SD adapter** will also work.
- On the **New 3DS** and **New 3DS XL**, the SD card is behind the backplate, which you will need a screwdriver to remove. These consoles use a **microSD card**.
- On the **New 2DS XL**, the SD card is under the same flap as the cartridge slot. This console uses a **microSD card**.

## SD card capacity

Despite Nintendo's support page, the 3DS can read SD cards larger than 32GB. The main constraint is that the 3DS can only read SD cards formatted as FAT32 (**not** exFAT or NTFS). You can use one of the following tools to format your SD card, depending on your operating system: [Windows](formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](formatting-sd-(linux)).

To follow this guide, you'll need **at least 1.3GB of free space** on your SD card. If you don't have enough space, consider getting a larger SD card beforehand!
