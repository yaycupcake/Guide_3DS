### Required Reading

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

### Compatibility Testing

To use this method, your console must be from a compatible region with a compatible browser version.

You can check these details from System Settings.

1. Open System Settings.
1. In the bottom right of the top screen, you will see a firmware version string in the format of `11.13.0-45x`.
  + The 45 is your browser version, and the letter is your region
  + If your browser version is less than 45, you will need to update the console through the System Settings "Software Update" option
  + E designates EUROPE
  + U designates USA
  + J designates JAPAN
  + If your console has a letter other than any of these three, it is not compatible with this method.
1. Remember your region designation. You will need to know this later.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [the Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu/releases/latest)
* The latest release archive of BrowserHax [[for Old 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/old-browserhax/releases/latest) / [for New 3DS](https://github.com/zoogie/new-browserhax/releases/latest)]
  + New/Old refers to the model of your console. If you are unsure of which model you have, consult [this image](https://3ds.eiphax.tech/pic/newold.png)
* An active WiFi connection on your console

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Copy `boot.3dsx` from the Homebrew Launcher release to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Copy `browserhax_hblauncher_ropbin_payload.bin` and `arm11code.bin` from the folder corresponding to your console's region to the root of your SD card

#### Section II - BrowserHax

1. From the HOME Menu, press the Left Shoulder and Right Shoulder buttons together
  + This should open a QR Scanner. If it does not, USM (the next part of getting custom firmware) will not work for you. You will need to use a [legacy method](legacy-methods)
  + If you need to type out the URL, it is `https://zoogie.github.io/web/nbhax/`
1. Use the QR scanner to scan the QR code you opened in the first step
1. Tap the "PROCEED TO HAXX" button
1. Wait for the process to complete
  + If it displays a yellow screen, power your console off, then try this section again
