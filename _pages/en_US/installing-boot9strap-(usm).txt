### Required Reading

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

We can do this using an existing exploit, BannerBomb3.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up), or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of Seedminer](bannerbomb3). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

### What You Need

* Your `movable.sed` file from completing [Seedminer](seedminer)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest)

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. If your device is powered on, power off your device
1. Open [unSAFE_MODE Exploit Injector](https://3ds.nhnarwhal.com/3dstools/unsafemode.php) on your computer
1. Upload your movable.sed using the "Choose File" option
1. Click "Build and Download"
  + This will download an exploit DSiWare called `F00D43D5.bin` and a SAFE_MODE exploit data file called `usm.bin` inside of a zip archive (`unSAFE_MODE.zip`)
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Copy `usm.bin` from `unSAFE_MODE.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + ![]({{ "/images/screenshots/usm-root-layout.png" | absolute_url }})
    {: .notice--info}

1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
  + The `<ID0>` will be the same one that you used in [Seedminer](seedminer)
  + The `<ID1>` is a 32 character long folder inside of the `<ID0>`
  + If `Nintendo DSiWare` does not exist, create it inside of the `<ID1>`
1. If there are any existing DSiWare backup files (`<8-character-id>.bin`) in this folder, move them to your PC
  + This will leave you with an empty Nintendo DSiWare folder. Moving the files to your PC ensures you don't delete any intentional backups
1. Copy the `F00D43D5.bin` file from `unSAFE_MODE.zip` to the `Nintendo DSiWare` folder

#### Section II - BannerBomb3

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your device should show a menu with some text
1. Select "Inject haxx"
  + Your device will automatically power off

#### Section III - unSAFE_MODE

1. With your device still powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), then press (Power)
  + Keep holding the buttons until the device boots into Safe Mode
1. Press "OK" to accept the update
  + There is no update. This is part of the exploit
1. Press "I accept" to accept the terms and conditions
1. The update will eventually fail, with the error code `003-1099`. This is intended behaviour
1. When asked "Would you like to configure Internet settings?", select "Yes"
1. On the following menu, navigate to `Connection 1` -> `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings` -> `Detailed Setup`
  + This is a [visual representation](https://uwuu.ca/images/safemode_highlighted.png)
1. Once you see `B9S install SUCCESS` on the top screen, press any button to reboot to Luma Configuration

#### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + You can access the Luma3DS configuration menu at any time by powering off, holding SELECT, then powering on your device while still holding SELECT
  + If you get a black screen, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#boot-related-issues-on-modded-devices)
1. Use the (A) button and the D-Pad to turn on the following:
  + **"Show NAND or user string in System Settings"**
1. Press (Start) to save and reboot

At this point, your console will boot to Luma3DS by default as long as the SD card is inserted.
  + Luma3DS does not look any different from the normal HOME Menu. If your console has booted into the HOME Menu, it is running custom firmware.
  + On the next page, you will copy Luma3DS to internal memory so that you can boot without an SD card.

#### Section V - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`
1. Click on the SD Card section
  + Your device should show a menu with some text
1. Select "Restore slots"
  + Your device will automatically power off
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder
