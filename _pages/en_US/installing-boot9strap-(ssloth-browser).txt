{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

SSLoth allows users on version 11.13.0 and below to bypass the browser version check, allowing use of new-browserhax, which can then be used in conjunction with universal-otherapp.

If you have updated your device to your current version using a cartridge, your Internet Browser will be inaccessible. If this is the case, you will need to update your device to the latest version through System Settings and then follow the method for the latest version.

The instructions provided only apply to the New 3DS, New 3DS XL, and New 2DS XL. Please ensure that the device you are modding is a New 3DS, New 3DS XL, or New 2DS XL before continuing.
