### Required Reading

To dump system DSiWare, we exploit a flaw in the DSiWare Data Management window of the Settings application.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system to dump the DSi Internet Settings application to the SD root.

Once you have a DSiWare backup, an exploitable DSiWare title can be injected into DS Download Play, which can be used to install custom firmware.

These instructions are for Taiwanese consoles ONLY (as indicated by a T at the end of the system version, e.g. 11.15.0-39T)! If your console is from any other region, [choose another method](seedminer#next-steps).
