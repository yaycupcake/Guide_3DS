As an additional safety measure, we will perform an additional check for custom firmware. This is because using this method when custom firmware is already installed has a risk of bricking the console (rendering it unusable without recovery methods like [ntrboot](ntrboot)).

1. Schakel je 3DS uit
1. Houd de (Select) knop ingedrukt
1. Zet je 3DS aan terwijl je de (Select) knop ingedrukt houdt
1. If the check was successful, you will boot to the HOME Menu and you may proceed with this guide
1. Schakel je 3DS uit

If you see a configuration menu or the console immediately powers off, you already have CFW, and continuing with these instructions may BRICK your device! Follow [Checking for CFW](checking-for-cfw) to upgrade your existing CFW.
