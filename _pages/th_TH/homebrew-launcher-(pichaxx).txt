<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your `movable.sed` file to write a custom save file for Pokémon Picross, which can then be used with unSAFE_MODE (via Homebrew Launcher) to run SafeB9SInstaller.

For information on PicHaxx itself, see [here](https://github.com/zoogie/pichaxx).

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, and Japan consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, or J after the system version.

You will need a Nintendo Network ID to download Pokémon Picross.

This process will overwrite your Pokémon Picross save file, if you have one. If you wish to preserve your Pokémon Picross game data, you should make a backup of your `00000001.sav` file before overwriting it.
