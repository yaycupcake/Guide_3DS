### Required Reading

The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints (methods of launching).

Soundhax (when combined with the Homebrew Launcher) is compatible with versions 9.0.0 through 11.3.0 in the EUR, JPN, KOR, and USA regions.

Ensure your device's Wireless Communication is turned on as udsploit (used in the next page) will need the wireless module to be active to function, and some devices (New 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS) cannot adjust the Wireless Communication setting from the Homebrew Launcher. Wireless Communication only has to be on; connecting it to an access point is not required.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [Soundhax](http://soundhax.com) *(for your region, device, and version)*
  + If Soundhax appears in your browser as an unplayable video, press Ctrl+S or Cmd+S to save it to your computer

* The latest release of [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/download/1.4/boot9strap-1.4.zip)
* The latest release of [safehax](https://github.com/TiniVi/safehax/releases/latest) *(the `.3dsx` file)*
* The latest release of [udsploit](https://github.com/smealum/udsploit/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest)

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Go to `/SDCARD`, then play "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + This may take many tries
  + If it freezes, just force the console to power off by holding the power button, then try again
  + If you get a red screen, ensure you copied `boot.3dsx` (the Homebrew Launcher) to the root of your SD card
