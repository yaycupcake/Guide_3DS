## Seedminer

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>Multiple long folder names in Nintendo 3DS folder</u></summary>

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/multiple-id0.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

This occurs when you use your SD card in multiple 3DS devices and is intended to prevent inadvertently merging data that would not be valid on other devices. To figure out which long folder name is correct for your 3DS, follow these instructions:

1. Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder to `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS`
1. Reinsert your SD card into your device and power on your device
1. Wait for the device to generate the SD card data
	+ Your applications will have disappeared. This is normal and will be resolved shortly
1. Power off your device and reinsert your SD card into your computer
1. Naviguez vers le dossier `Nintendo 3DS` de votre carte SD
1. Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see
	+ This is your true ID0 that you will use in [Section II of Seedminer](seedminer#section-ii---seedminer)
1. Delete the `Nintendo 3DS` folder
1. Rename the `BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS` folder to `Nintendo 3DS`

<summary><u>Bruteforce Movable skips to step 4</u></summary>

The website has already mined your `movable.sed` using your friend code and ID0 combination. You can use the `movable.sed` that it provides you.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>Important! You have been locked out of the automated part1 dumper system...</u></summary>

Your friend code was blocked from using the friend code bot because your 3DS did not successfully friend the bot. Ensure your 3DS is properly connected to the Internet, then join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask to be unlocked.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>We were unable to successfully complete your bruteforce request. :`(</u></summary>

The website has determined that your `movable.sed` cannot be brute-forced. Ensure that you gave the correct ID0 to the website. If your ID0 is correct, then you will be unable to use Seedminer and you will have to use an alternate method that will require additional games or hardware.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

## BannerBomb3

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>Multiple ID1 folders inside of ID0</u></summary>

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/multiple-id1.png" | absolute_url }})

This can occur if you've used multiple SD cards on a 3DS and then merged the contents of the SD cards together. This is done to prevent conflicting, valid data from being merged together.

To fix this, you will need to determine which folder contains your data. Usually, this will be the larger (or largest) of the folders. Backup and delete the smaller one(s), then create a `Nintendo DSiWare` folder in the one that remains and move `F00D43D5.bin` to that location.

{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>DSiWare Management menu crashes without showing BB3 multihax menu</u></summary>
Ensure that `F00D43D5.bin` is the only file in `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. If it is, then re-create it with the [Bannerbomb3 Injector](http://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen). 

Also, ensure that `bb3.bin` is on the root of the SD card. If it is missing, then download the latest release of [Bannerbomb3](https://github.com/lifehackerhansol/Bannerbomb3/releases/download/v3.0-lhs1/bb3.bin) (direct download), and copy the `bb3.bin` file to the root of your SD card.

If neither of these solutions fixes this problem, then custom firmware may have been uninstalled on this device in a way that makes this method impossible to perform. Si c'est le cas, rejoignez [Nintendo Homebrew sur Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) et demandez de l'aide, en anglais.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>DSiWare Management menu displays "No accessible software data."</u></summary>

`F00D43D5.bin` is missing from `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare`. Make sure that `Nintendo DSiWare` is correctly spelled and spaced. Uppercase/lowercase does not matter.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>DSiWare Management shows a question mark</u></summary>

There may be an issue with your `F00D43D5.bin` file (it may be corrupted or intended for the wrong 3DS). Re-create your `F00D43D5.bin` file with the [Bannerbomb3 Injector](http://3dstools.nhnarwhal.com/#/bb3gen), ensuring that you use the `movable.sed` file for your console.

Follow these steps in order:

1. Launch the System Settings application
1. Navigate to `Internet Settings` -> `Connection Settings`
1. Click on your network connection slot and navigate to `Change Settings` -> `Next Page (right arrow)` -> `Proxy Settings`
1. Set "Proxy Settings" to "No"
1. Click OK, then click Save
1. When prompted, click "Test" to perform the connection test
  + The test should succeed
1. Click "OK" to continue
1. Press "Back" twice, then "Close" to go back to the HOME Menu
1. Open the Internet Browser once
1. If prompted about a system update, press OK
  + This won't actually update the system
1. Start again from [Section II](installing-boot9strap-(ssloth-browser).html#section-ii---ssloth)
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>"To use the Internet Browser, please update your system using the System Update option in the System Settings."</u></summary>

First, make sure you entered the correct proxy for the connection you're using. If not, go back to [Section II](installing-boot9strap-(ssloth-browser).html#section-ii---ssloth). If the proxy is correct, then your device has been cart-updated, which means an alternate exploit will need to be used.

<u>Method 1</u><br>
If the two numbers before the region in the system version string is equal to or less than 36 (e.g. Ver. 11.14.0-**36**U), you can follow [Soundhax](installing-boot9strap-(soundhax)). When prompted to select a firmware to generate the sound file, use:

* 1.x - 2.1 if the number is between 0 and 2
* 2.1 - 2.2 if the number is between 3 and 4
* 3.x - 4.x if the number is between 5 and 10
* 5.x - 11.3 if the number is between 11 and 36

<u>Method 2 (Old 3DS only)</u><br>
If you have an Old 3DS / Old 3DS XL / 2DS, you can try a Safe Mode update, which will trigger an alternate exploit:

1. Ensure that the proxy that you used for SSLoth is still actively applied to your internet connection
1. With your device powered off, hold the following buttons: (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A), and while holding these buttons together, power on your device
  + Maintenez les boutons enfoncés jusqu'à ce que la console démarre en mode sans échec (menu "Mise à jour")
1. Appuyez sur "OK" pour accepter la mise à jour
1. If everything worked correctly, the update will fail and the 3DS will boot into SafeB9SInstaller. If it did, then continue from [Section IV](installing-boot9strap-(ssloth-browser)#section-iv---installing-boot9strap).

If these methods didn't work (or do not apply to you), update your device to the latest version and follow [Seedminer](seedminer).

## Boot issues on devices with custom firmware

The steps detailed here generally assume that your device has a modern custom firmware setup (boot9strap + Luma3DS 8.0 or greater). If your console is running an older homebrew setup (for example, something based on arm9loaderhax or menuhax), you should update your setup before trying these instructions.

### Power/notification light indicators

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>My device powers off when I try to turn it on, and/or the notification LED shows a color on boot</u></summary>

There is an issue with your `boot.firm` file. If you're running [boot9strap 1.4](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/tag/1.4), your 3DS notification LED may flash a certain color. This color is used to diagnose issues involving your `boot.firm` file on SD card or internal memory. On older versions of boot9strap, the blue light will power off almost immediately when trying to turn on the device.

If the notification LED flashes:

- **White**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card or on internal memory.
- **Magenta**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card. It was able to find `boot.firm` on internal memory, but the file is corrupted.
- **Red**: Your 3DS was able to find `boot.firm` on both your SD card and on internal memory, but both files are corrupted.

You can get a new `boot.firm` file by downloading the [latest release of Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest), extracting it, and placing `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card. If your `boot.firm` file is consistently being detected as corrupted, you may want to check your SD card for errors ([Windows](h2testw-(windows)), [Linux](f3-(linux)), or [macOS](f3xswift-(mac))). Also, note that the 3DS tends to have issues with files extracted using WinRAR.

If you hear a "popping sound", potentially accompanied with the backlight turning on for a split second, there is a hardware issue with your device (such as a disconnected backlight cable). You may be able to get your device to boot by holding it at certain angles.

<summary><u>My device gets stuck on a black screen with blue power light staying on</u></summary>

The steps below can be attempted in any order, but are listed from least to most time-consuming.

1. Power off your device, remove the SD card, re-insert it, then power on your device.
1. Power off your device, eject the game cartridge if inserted, power on your device, then wait up to ten minutes. If your device boots within ten minutes, the issue has been fixed and is unlikely to reoccur
1. Rename the `Nintendo 3DS` folder on your SD card to `Nintendo 3DS_BACKUP`, then attempt to boot. If your device successfully boots, there is some issue within your `Nintendo 3DS` folder. Try clearing HOME Menu extdata:
	+ Navigate to `/Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/extdata/00000000/`
  + Delete the corresponding folder for your 3DS region: 
		+ **Région EUR** : `00000098`
		+ **Région JPN** : `00000082`
		+ **Région USA** : `0000008f`
		+ **Région CHN** : `000000A1`
		+ **Région KOR** : `000000A9`
		+ **Région TWN** : `000000B1`
1. Try booting into recovery mode and updating your system:
	+ Éteignez votre console
	+ Hold (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A)
	+ Power on your device
	+ If you were successful, the device will boot to an "update your system" screen
1. Follow the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide

### Error message on boot

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>"An error has occurred: Failed to apply 1 FIRM patch(es)" or "An exception has occurred -- Current process: pm"</u></summary>

Your Luma3DS version is outdated. Download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) and place `boot.firm` on the root of your SD card, replacing any existing file. Make sure you are extracting the ZIP file with any tool other than WinRAR, as it is known to cause issues with 3DS-related files.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>"Unable to mount CTRNAND or load the CTRNAND FIRM. Please use an external one."</u></summary>
There are a number of reasons as to why this could be happening. In any case, this error can usually be fixed by following the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide.
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>"An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..."</u></summary>

ARM11 exception handlers are disabled, or custom firmware is not installed. Try enabling ARM11 exception handlers:
  + Éteignez votre console
  + Hold (Select)
  + Power on your device, while still holding (Select)
  + If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it
{% endcapture %}
<details>{{ compat | markdownify }}</details>

{% capture compat %}
<summary><u>HOME Menu is missing installed applications</u></summary>

This could be caused by various reasons, but most likely because your SD card is not being read by the system.
You can check if your SD is being read by holding SELECT on boot and checking the yellow text on the bottom screen; if it says "Booted from CTRNAND via B9S", then your device is booting from the internal memory and not from the SD card.
If this is the case, attempt the steps below, which are listed from easiest to hardest:
1. Power off your device, remove the SD card, re-insert it, then power on your device
1. Power off your device, remove the SD card, insert it on your PC, download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest), extract `boot.firm` from the `Luma3DS.zip` and place it on the root of your SD card (replacing any existing file)
1. Power off your device, remove the SD card, insert it on your PC and reformat your SD card according to your computer's operating system: [Windows](formatting-sd-(windows)), [macOS](formatting-sd-(mac)), [Linux](formatting-sd-(linux)) *(this will wipe your SD card data)*
1. Test your SD card for errors by following the guide according to your computer's operating system: [Windows](h2testw-(windows)), [Linux](f3-(linux)), [macOS](f3xswift-(mac)). If your SD card is marked as faulty, then you will have to replace your SD card

<summary><u>Blue "BOOTROM ERROR" screen</u></summary>

Your device is likely hard-bricked. You will need to buy an ntrboot flashcart to reinstall boot9strap in order to attempt to fix your device. This may also indicate a hardware issue that cannot be fixed. In any case, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.
  + It is also possible that someone has set a boot-time splash screen that just looks like a brick. Try leaving your device powered on, waiting on the blue screen, for five minutes.
