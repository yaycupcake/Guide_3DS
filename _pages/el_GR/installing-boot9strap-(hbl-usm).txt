<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

As we already have Homebrew access, we can use slotTool to do this.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

For a more technical explanation, see [here](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/) for information about the unSAFE_MODE exploit.

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will use Homebrew Launcher to launch slotTool, which will overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Then, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your device's SD card. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Power on your device
1. Open the Homebrew Launcher through your method of choice (likely the Internet Browser)
1. Launch slotTool from the list of homebrew
  + If you get stuck on a red screen, forcefully power off the console by holding the power button for fifteen seconds, then retry this section
1. Select the "INSTALL exploit to wifi slots 1,2,3 & shutdown" option
  + You will see some on-screen text and then your system will shut down
1. Remove your SD card from your console and connect it to your computer
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `usm.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Put your SD card back into your console
