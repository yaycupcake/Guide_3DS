1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card

1. If you've never opened Nintendo 3DS Sound before and get tips on how to use it from a bird icon, go through all of the bird tips, then close the app normally and relaunch it
  + In this situation, launching Soundhax immediately would cause these tips to appear on every launch of the Nintendo 3DS Sound until this is done
1. Μεταβείτε στο `/SDCARD`, στην συνέχεια παίξτε το "<3 nedwill 2016"
  + Μπορεί να χρειαστούν αρκετές προσπάθειες

#### Section III - Installing boot9strap

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
1. Once it is complete, press (A) to reboot your device
1. Your device should have rebooted into the Luma3DS configuration menu
  + If your device shuts down when you try to power it on, ensure that you have copied `boot.firm` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Πατήστε (Start) για αποθήκευση των αλλαγών και επανεκκίνηση
  + If you get an error, just continue to the next page
