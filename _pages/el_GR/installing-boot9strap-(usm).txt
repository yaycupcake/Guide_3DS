<summary><em>Technical Details (optional)</em></summary>

In order to exploit the SAFE_MODE firmware of our system, we need to inject an exploited WiFi profile.

We can do this using an existing exploit, BannerBomb3.

To accomplish this, we use your system's encryption key (movable.sed) to build a DSiWare backup that exploits the system in order to inject the exploited WiFi profile into your connections list.

Once the WiFi profile has been injected, we will use SAFE_MODE, which is a recovery feature present on all 3DS consoles, to activate the exploited WiFi profile.

For a more technical explanation, see the following links for information on the BannerBomb3 and unSAFE_MODE exploits: [BannerBomb3](https://github.com/zoogie/Bannerbomb3), [unSAFE_MODE](https://github.com/zoogie/unSAFE_MODE/).

### Compatibility Notes

These instructions work on USA, Europe, Japan, and Korea region consoles as indicated by the letters U, E, J, or K after the system version.

If your (Right/Left Shoulder), (D-Pad Up), or (A) buttons do not work, you will need to follow [an alternate branch of Seedminer](installing-boot9strap-(fredtool)). For assistance with this matter, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) and ask, in English, for help.

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger the unSAFE_MODE exploit onto your device's SD card.

1. Your SD card should be inserted in your computer
1. Copy `usm.bin` to the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot.firm` and `boot.3dsx` from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
  + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your SD card
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.bin` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card

#### Section II - BannerBomb3

In this section, you will trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit using the DSiWare Management menu, which can be used to overwrite your Wi-Fi slots with hacked data. Your Wi-Fi connection settings will be temporarily overwritten while the exploit is active.

1. Reinsert your SD card into your device
1. Power on your device
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`-> `SD Card` ([image](/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-management.png))
  + Your device should show the BB3 multihax menu
  + If the BB3 multihax menu doesn't open, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#bannerbomb3)
  + If the BB3 multihax menu says "cfw installed already", you already have custom firmware and should continue from [here](checking-for-cfw)
1. Use the D-Pad to navigate and press the (A) button to select "Install unSAFE_MODE"
  + Your device will automatically power off
1. Power on your device
1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Internet Settings` -> `Connection Settings`
1. Ensure that all three connections are named "Haaaaaaaxxxxxxxxx..."
  + Do NOT change these settings!
  + If all three connections are NOT all named "Haaaaaaaxxxxxxxxx...", STOP! Something went wrong in this section and MUST be fixed before you can continue
1. Power off your device

#### Section V - Restoring WiFi Configuration Profiles

In this section, you will trigger the BannerBomb3 exploit a second time so that you can restore the Wi-Fi connection slots that were overwritten in Section II.

1. Launch System Settings on your device
1. Navigate to `Data Management` -> `DSiWare`-> `SD Card` ([image](/images/screenshots/bb3/dsiware-management.png))
1. Use the D-Pad to navigate and press the (A) button to select "Uninstall unSAFE_MODE"
  + Your device will automatically reboot
1. Power off your device
1. Εισάγετε την κάρτα SD στον υπολογιστή σας
1. Navigate to `Nintendo 3DS` -> `<ID0>` -> `<ID1>` -> `Nintendo DSiWare` on your SD card
1. Delete `F00D43D5.bin` from your Nintendo DSiWare folder and from your computer. This file will not be needed anymore
