### Lectura requerida

This method of accessing the Homebrew Launcher takes advantage of some browser oversights in the native 3DS Internet Browser.

### Compatibility Testing

To use this method, your console must be from a compatible region with a compatible browser version.

You can check these details from System Settings.

1. Open System Settings.
1. In the bottom right of the top screen, you will see a firmware version string in the format of `11.13.0-45x`.
  + The 45 is your browser version, and the letter is your region
  + If your browser version is less than 45, you will need to update the console through the System Settings "Software Update" option
  + E designates EUROPE
  + U designates USA
  + J designates JAPAN
  + If your console has a letter other than any of these three, it is not compatible with this method.
1. Remember your region designation. You will need to know this later.
