; by about 10%. Can break some games and other applications.
; Context: core1 is the core where all sysmodules (device drivers,
; etc.) except head tracking run on. Applications can request to
; run threads on that core a percentage of the total CPU time,
; but this reduces the time sysmodules can run. This patch
; prevents this from happening.
